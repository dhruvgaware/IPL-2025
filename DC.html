        <p><b><h2>Franchise history</h2></b></p>
    
        <hr/>

        <p>The IPL is a cricket league organised by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and backed by the International Cricket Council (ICC). The inaugural tournament was held in April–June 2008, in which the BCCI finalised a list of eight teams that participated in the tournament. The teams represented eight different cities in India, including Delhi. The teams were put up for auction in Mumbai on 20 February 2008, and the Delhi team was bought by the property development company GMR Group for US$84 million.[3]

            In March 2018, GMR sold a 50% stake in the Delhi Daredevils to JSW Sports for ₹550 crore (US$64 million).[4]
            
            JSW Sports is also the owner of Hockey India League team Soorma Hockey Club, Pro Kabaddi League team Haryana Steelers, Indian Super League team Bengaluru FC, SA20 team Pretoria Capitals, and ILT20 team Dubai Capitals.
            
            In December 2018, the team changed its name from the Delhi Daredevils to the Delhi Capitals.[5] Speaking about the rationale behind changing the team's name, co-owner and chairman Parth Jindal said, "Delhi is the power centre of the country, it is the capital, therefore the name Delhi Capitals."[6] Co-owner Kiran Kumar Grandhi said, "The new name symbolizes Delhi's identity and just like the city, we are aiming to be the centre of all action going forward."[7]
            
            Subject to ratification by the England and Wales Cricket Board, in 2024 the franchise agreed a £120 million deal to buy Hampshire County Cricket Club in England, as well as a 51% stake in the Hundred team Southern Brave.[8]

        <hr/>

        <p>During the inaugural edition of the IPL, the Delhi Daredevils won their initial two matches against the Rajasthan Royals and the Deccan Chargers. Then, after losing a match to the Kings XI Punjab, the team won their next two matches against the Royal Challengers Bangalore and the Chennai Super Kings.[citation needed]

            However, the Delhi Daredevils lost in four straight matches, breaking the streak with a win against the Deccan Chargers.[9] After another loss against the Kings XI Punjab,[10] they recovered and won three matches to finish in the final four of the league.
            
            The Delhi Daredevils lost to eventual champions, the Rajasthan Royals, in the semi-final.[11]</p>

        <p><b><h2>Team Anthem</h2></b></p>
    
        <hr/>

        <p>Bollywood playback singer Kailash Kher was the artist for the team's anthem "Khelo Front Foot Pe" ("Play on the front foot") or "play aggressively".[37]

            The Delhi Daredevils launched their new anthem "Munday Dilli Ke" ("The Lads from Delhi"), sung by Jaspreet Jasz and composed by Arijit Datta and Micu Patel, on 5 March 2012 on YouTube.[38][39]
            
            Their anthem for the 2016 season of IPL, titled "Dhuandaar Dilli", was released on YouTube, sung by Sukhwinder Singh.[40]
            
            In 2018, they released yet another theme song, titled "Dil Dilli hai, ab Dhadkega".
            
            The theme song for the 2019 season for the rechristened franchise, the Delhi Capitals, was "Roar Machaa" sung by Amit Trivedi.[41]</p>
