    <p><b> Gujarat Titants (GT) </b>are a professional franchise cricket team based in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India. The Titans compete in the Indian Premier League (IPL).[1][2][3] Founded in 2021, Gujarat Titans' home ground is Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. The franchise is owned by Torrent Group and CVC Capital Partners. The team is currently captained by Shubman Gill.[4] The Gujarat Titans are coached by Ashish Nehra.[5][6] They won their maiden title in the 2022 season under the captaincy of Hardik Pandya, which was also their debut season.</p>

    <p><b><h2>Franchise history</h2></b></p>

    <hr/>

    <p> The Governing Council of the Indian Premier League issued an invitation to tender for two new sides in August 2021.[7] A total of 22 companies declared an interest, but with a high base price for the new teams, there were no more than six serious bidders. The Board of Control for Cricket in India allowed a consortium of three companies or individuals to bid for each franchise. In October 2021, CVC Capital Partners won the rights to operate the Ahmedabad franchise with a bid of â‚¹5,625 crore (US$660 million).[8][9][10] Ahead of the IPL 2022 auctions, the franchise drafted Hardik Pandya as their captain.[5] In February 2022, the team was officially named Gujarat Titans.[11][12]</p>

    <p><b><h2>Team history</h2></b></p>

    <hr/>

    <p>Although their auction methods and their selections during their first-ever auction were considered weak, and the team was written off, the Titans surprised everyone with their performances, gaining their first win against fellow newcomers Lucknow Super Giants. That win was the first in their inaugural campaign, which saw the Titans eventually win 10 of their 14 group matches, qualifying at the top of the table with 20 points. They then won the first qualifier against Rajasthan Royals, whom they would meet again in the final after their qualifier win against Royal Challengers Bangalore. Gujarat won the final by restricting Rajasthan to 130 on a pitch on which they were asked to bowl first, and chasing down the target with 11 balls to spare, which included Shubman Gill hitting the winning six off the first ball of the 19th over. Hardik Pandya was adjudged the Man of the Match for his bowling figures of 3/17 and his 34 from 30 balls with a strike rate of 113.33. Critics have praised Pandya's captaincy, bowling, and batting, with many agreeing that he and the management used their players well and worked as a team to win the tournament.[13]</p>
