<p><b> Chennai Super kings </b>is an Indian professional T20 cricket franchise based in Chennai, Tamil Nadu. The team competes in the Indian Premier League (IPL) and was one of the eight franchises incorporated when the league was established in 2008. The team plays its home matches at the M. A. Chidambaram Stadium and is owned by Chennai Super Kings Cricket.

    The Super Kings is the joint-most successful IPL franchise (along with Mumbai Indians), having won five IPL titles. It has also appeared in ten finals and qualified for the playoff stages 12 times, the most amongst the IPL teams. The franchise has also won the Champions League Twenty20 twice in 2010 and 2014. The team is currently captained by M S Dhoni and coached by Stephen Fleming.
    
    The Super Kings was suspended for two years from the IPL from July 2015 to 2017 due to the involvement of its owners in the 2013 IPL betting case. The franchise re-joined the tournament for the 2018 season and won the title in its comeback season. In January 2022, CSK became India's first unicorn sports enterprise. As of 2022, it was the second most valuable IPL franchise with a valuation of $1.15 billion.  </p>

    <p>
        In September 2007, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) announced the establishment of the Indian Premier League (IPL), a Twenty20 competition with the inaugural season planned for 2008.[1] Chennai was one of the eight city-based franchises unveiled for the inaugural edition in January 2008.[2]

        The player auction for the inaugural IPL season took place in January 2008. Then captain of the Indian team MS Dhoni was bought by the Super Kings for $1.5 million, the most expensive buy at the auction.[3] The franchise also bought international cricketers Suresh Raina, Matthew Hayden, Jacob Oram, Stephen Fleming, Muttiah Muralitharan and Michael Hussey in the inaugural auction.[4] Ahead of the inaugural season, the franchise named Dhoni as the captain of the team and appointed Kepler Wessels as the head coach.[5][6] The team played its first game in the IPL on 19 April 2008 against Punjab Kings (then Kings XI Punjab) at Mohali, which it won by 33 runs.[7] The Super Kings finished the league stage in third place with eight wins from 14 games.[8] In the semifinal, the franchise beat Kings XI Punjab by nine wickets to reach the maiden IPL final.[9] In the final at Mumbai, Rajasthan Royals won the match off the last ball to defeat the Super Kings and lifted the first IPL title.[10] By finishing as the runners-up in the IPL, the Super Kings qualified for the inaugural season of the Champions League Twenty20 (CLT20). The tournament was later cancelled as a consequence of the 2008 Mumbai attacks and the Super Kings was given $5 million as compensation from the BCCI for the same.[11]</p>

        <hr/>

        <p>The Super Kings play their home matches at the M. A. Chidambaram Stadium (also known as "Chepauk") in Chennai, which is one of the oldest cricket stadiums in India.[132][133] The stadium is owned by the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association and has a seating capacity of 38,000.[132] The stadium is often referred to as "Fortress Chepauk" and "Lions' den".[134][135]

            In 2014, the Super Kings played their home matches at the JSCA International Cricket Stadium at Ranchi due to a dispute with the Government of Tamil Nadu regarding the usage of three stands at the Chepauk stadium.[136][137] In 2018, the team played six of its home games at the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium in Pune after members of some of the political parties staged protests outside the Chepauk stadium and the Tamil Nadu Police indicated their inability to provide security for the subsequent matches.[138][139]</p>
