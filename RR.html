    <p><b>Rajasthan Royals</b>(often abbreviated as RR) are a professional franchise cricket team based in Jaipur, Rajasthan, that competes in the Indian Premier League (IPL).[3] Founded in 2008 as one of the initial eight IPL franchises, the team is owned by Manoj Badale and The Royals Sports Group.[4] The Royals team is based at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur.[5][6] It plays its home matches at Sawai Mansingh Stadium and at Assam Cricket Association Stadium, Guwahati.[7]

        The team won the inaugural edition of the IPL under the captaincy of Shane Warne, despite being written off as a title contender by the media and fans. The Royals were also the runners-up of the 2013 Champions League Twenty20 under Rahul Dravid's captaincy,[7][8] and the runners-up of the 2022 Indian Premier League under the captaincy of Sanju Samson and leadership of Kumar Sangakkara. The team qualified for playoffs in 2024 Indian Premier League but lost to Sunrisers Hyderabad in qualifier 2 by 36 runs under the captaincy of Sanju Samson and leadership of Sangakkara. The team has announced former team India coach and ex-Rajasthan Royals player and mentor Rahul Dravid as a Head Coach for IPL 2025.[9]
        
        On 14 July 2015, the verdict reached by a panel appointed by the Supreme Court of India suspended Rajasthan Royals and Chennai Super Kings for two years over a 2013 betting scandal, meaning they could not participate in both the 2016 and 2017 IPL tournaments. The team returned to the competition with the 2018 season.
        
        The team's record run-scorer is Sanju Samson with 3403 runs,[10] while the leading wicket-taker is Shane Watson, with 67 wickets.</p>

        <p><b><h2>Franchise history</h2></b></p>
    
        <hr/>

        <p>The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) announced the establishment of the Indian Premier League (IPL) in September 2007, a Twenty20 competition to be started in 2008.[12] The Rajasthan Royals were one of the original eight teams in the inaugural season of the IPL in 2008. Emerging Media gained ownership of the Jaipur-based franchise team with a bid of $67 million, making it the least expensive team in the league.[3]

            As of 2024,[13] the franchise is owned by the Royals Sports Group (Emerging Media Sporting Holdings Limited), which holds a 65% stake. Key minority stakeholders include Lachlan Murdoch and RedBird Capital Partners.[14] There have been past controversies regarding the ownership of the franchise, leading to a brief expulsion of the team from the league in 2010.[15] The franchise made a pre-tax profit of $7.5 million in 2009.[16]</p>

            <br/>

    <p><b><h2>Ban in 2015</h2></b></p>

    <hr/>

    <p>In 2015, the team was banned for two years following the Lodha Committee inquiry.[25]

        Rajasthan Royals became the source of controversy when inappropriate and fictitious bids were made, violating the BCCI norms.[26] Ranjit Barthakur and Fraser Castellino were the only two shareholders of the team, which was completely unknown to the BCCI at the time.[27][28] An out-of-court settlement between the two ensued.[citation needed] In 2015, Rajasthan Royals were banned for two years by the BCCI, with its owner Raj Kundra banned for life.[29]</p>

        <br/>

        <p><b><h2> Home Ground  </h2></b></p>
    
        <hr/>

        <p>The home venue of the Royals is the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur. The stadium was built during the reign of Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II. It is situated at one corner of the Rambagh Circle. The stadium seats 24,000 after the 2006 renovation. The Sardar Patel Stadium in Ahmedabad has also hosted Rajasthan Royals' home matches.[88] The Assam Cricket Association Stadium, Guwahati in Assam has also hosted the Rajasthan Royals' matches for the 2023 season.[89]

            The Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur once again started to host the Royals' home games from the 2018 IPL season onwards after their return from a two-year suspension which also saw the stadium being banned from hosting matches for four years.</p>
