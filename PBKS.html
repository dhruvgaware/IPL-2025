    <p><b>Punjab Kings (PBKS), formerly Kings XI Punjab (KXIP)</b> is a professional franchise cricket team based in Mullanpur Garibdass, Mohali, and Punjab that plays in the Indian Premier League. The franchise is jointly owned by Mohit Burman, Ness Wadia, Preity Zinta and Karan Paul. The team plays its home matches at the Maharaja Yadavindra Singh International Cricket Stadium, although since the 2010 season, they have played some matches at Dharamshala and Indore. Apart from the 2014 season when they topped the league table and finished runners-up, the team has only made one other playoff appearance.

        The franchise played in the now-defunct Champions League Twenty20 once, in 2014 when they finished as semi-finalists. The team name was changed to Punjab Kings in February 2021. In 2025 IPL auction, the franchise made the then highest-ever bid for a player in the IPL, paying ₹26.75 crore (US$3.1 million) for Shreyas Iyer.[2]</p>

        <p><b><h2>Franchise history</h2></b></p>
    
        <hr/>

        <p> In 2007, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) created the cricket tournament the Indian Premier League, based on the Twenty20 format of the game. Franchises for eight cities were made available in an auction held in Mumbai on 20 February 2008. The team representing Punjab was bought by the Dabur group's Mohit Burman (46%), the Wadia group's Ness Wadia (23%), Preity Zinta (23%), and Saptarshi Dey of the Dey & Dey Group (minor stake). The group paid a total of $76 million to acquire the franchise.

            As the Kings XI Punjab, the franchise's catchment areas were the regions of Kashmir, Jammu, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana—evident from the letter sequence "K J H P H" in the banner of the team's old logo.[3][4]</p>

            <br/>

            <p><b><h2>Name Change </h2></b></p>
        
            <hr/>

            <p>On 17 February 2021, Kings XI Punjab was renamed to Punjab Kings, ahead of the 2021 Indian Premier League.[9][10][11] Ness Wadia explained the reason for changing the franchise name was to "relook at things" and rebrand after 13 seasons of the IPL. He expressed his disappointment over the franchise for "not being able to win a title" and expected them to "start afresh" after a name change. He added that the name change had been planned two years ago and COVID-19 had just delayed the announcement.[12]</p>

            <p><b><h2>Expulsion from the IPL and return </h2></b></p>
        
            <hr/>

            <p>Following the controversy surrounding the BCCI and Lalit Modi in 2010, the Indian Premier League announced on 10 October 2010 that it had terminated the franchise contracts of Kings XI Punjab and the Rajasthan Royals. The teams announced that they would take legal action to remain in the Indian Premier League.[5] Initially, the team tried to negotiate a solution with the league, but when one could not be reached, they decided to file a case in the Bombay High Court. They accused the IPL of getting rid of the two teams so that when the bidding process would start for the 2012 IPL season, the contract would be given to a more lucrative bidder.[6]

                The termination order was stayed by the Bombay High Court,[7] and the legal dispute between the BCCI and the franchise ended in 2012.[8]</p>
