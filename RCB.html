        <p>Before the 2013 auction, RCB released Mohammad Kaif, Charl Langeveldt, Dirk Nannes, Luke Pomersbach, and Rilee Rossouw.[52] At the auction, they acquired Christopher Barnwell, Daniel Christian, Moises Henriques, Ravi Rampaul, Pankaj Singh, R.

            Before the 2014 auction, RCB retained AB de Villiers, Chris Gayle, and Virat Kohli from previous seasons.[59] The players bought in the 2014 auction included Albie Morkel, Mitchell Starc, Parthiv Patel, Ashok Dinda, Nic Maddinson, Varun Aaron, Yuzvendra Chahal, Vijay Zol, and Yuvraj Singh, who was the most expensive player at ₹14 crore (equivalent to ₹22 crore or US$2.6 million in 2023), among others.[60] Daniel Vettori replaced Ray Jennings as the head coach of the team.[61] The first phase of the IPL was held in the UAE and the second phase in India.[62] RCB finished 7th in the points table and did not qualify for the playoffs.[63] De Villiers was the highest run-scorer for the team with 395 runs, while Varun Aaron took the most wickets, claiming 16.[64][65]

            <hr/>

            <p> Vijay Mallya wanted to associate one of his top-selling liquor brands, either McDowell's No.1 or Royal Challenge with the team.[144] The latter was chosen, hence the name.

                The logo initially consisted of the RC emblem in yellow on a circular red base with the black text "Royal Challengers Bangalore" in standard format surrounding the circular logo. The RC crown emblem with the roaring lion placed on the top of the logo was derived from the original Royal Challenge logo. No significant changes took place in the design of the logo except for the replacement of colour yellow with gold from 2009. This logo also had a dotted white circle around the RC emblem. The team also uses an alternate logo for the Game for Green matches where the green plants surround the logo and the text Game for Green is placed below the logo. The logo was redesigned in 2016 with the inclusion of black as a secondary colour. The lion emblem in the crest was enlarged and the shield was omitted in the new design. In 2020, a new logo was unveiled featuring a bigger lion and the crown returning from the previous logo. The RC emblem was omitted for this crest.[145] In 2024 Logo changed again in which RCB written on top and Royal Challengers Bangalore are renamed as Royal Challengers Bengaluru. The Royal Challengers Bengaluru appears at the bottom</p>

                <p>The Royal Challengers have a huge and passionate fan base all over India and especially in the city of Bangalore. The fans, known to be loyal and vocal in their support,[161] often turn up in large numbers for RCB's home matches, turning the stadium into what is called a "sea of red".[162][163][164] They are well known for their chants of "R-C-B, R-C-B", chants of "Ee Sala Cup Namde" (transl. This year the cup is ours) for RCB 1st IPL Trophy[165] and chants of "A-B-D, A-B-D" for their maestro batsman AB de Villiers,[166][167] and the co-ordinated Mexican wave at the Chinnaswamy.[168] The stadium organisers also provide the home team fans with cheer kits, RCB flags and noisemakers among other items.[169] Royal Challengers Bangalore have formed a fan-following group named as Bold Army.

                    During the 2014 IPL, the Royal Challengers became the first team to provide free Wi-Fi connectivity to fans at their home ground. 50 access points were set up using fibre-optic cables to provide the connectivity to fans on match days at the Chinnaswamy.[170]</p>
